NOTE: The following blog post was inspired by a talk I heard today.  I'm not in the trolling business, so I'm not going to name names here, but I'm writing this as a cathartic response that I felt uncomfortable unleashing openly on the offending party...

Have you ever heard the term "corporate shill?"  If you haven't, [here's what Wikipedia says][shill]:

  * A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. 

I entitled this blog post "Metacorporate Shills."  This is because I think the traditional corporate shill has become a relic: If I had to draw some kind of illustration, for some reason I keep seeing a 21st century Willy Loman (does that make sense?);  I see the image of a deranged aging boomer woman that can only (kind of) get off at night thinking about how fucking baller her Tupperware(tm) Parties were back in 1988.  Or a cigarette obsessed cowboy with a home entirely furnished with a branded bed, couch, and pool table purchased using only his once valuable Camel Cash. 

Being a mere "corporate shill" is a psychotic form of antiquated nostalgia, and while such a role most likely always had some flavor of derangement or psychosis or deviancy, it is no longer a socially acceptable flavor in higher functioning circles of society.  Mediated society of today has gone to great lengths to emphasize that corporations ARE people, and that we are all "brand ambassadors" by simply taking part in today's hyper-mediated virtual landscape.  This means that it is DANGEROUSLY easy to become second-order shills... 

That's right!  There is a new form of shill walking our streets, reforming workflow in our offices, administrating at our schools, deploying media deliverables over our airwaves/networks, and marketing "their brand."  Like the corporate shill before them, these people are ignorant of their disease, and in spreading their viral thought processes believe (in most cases) that they are performing a public service. 

Unlike their ancestors, Metacorporate Shills are not self-definingly impressed with some pyramidal distribution of a product or luxury resort.  The lifestyle/product they are selling does not have a price tag (though their recorded conversations and appearances often do).  The Metacorporate Shill lives in a bubble where everything is so beyond-corporate, that even an anti-corporate stance is sold to you the same way it was sold to the shill: through privilege, through naivet√©, through social preservation.

One of the biggest meta-corporate themes running is technology/media.  I am often awe struck at the voices that are granted the reigns of this topic's narrative.  Most of these voices are driven by consumption and simulations of political stance.  The odd thing is that these voices are driven by arguments based on agreement.

-----

Here's an example I tossed together using a combination of things I've heard recently, both in person or on the television--

Metacorporate Shill A: Technology is a great thing, it allows great thinkers like Mark Zuckerberg or Ray Kurzweil to help re-integrate a recovering economy into a productive stance.  This is why we need more science in our schools, if people don't learn to use this technology they will be left behind!

Metacorporate Shill B:  But technology is also a terrible thing!  For every great thing it does, it comes at a social cost!  We are now serving our technology instead of having the technology serve us, the same systems that allow for us to more rapidly aid a struggling cancer victim have burdened the typical citizen in a psychological way. They become enslaved to this timeless technology's demands.  Facebook is SELLING your friends, in what world is that okay?  I won't disagree that we need to LEARN technology, but for the exact opposite reason you state.  If we don't learn it, learn how to "fork" it for the betterment of mankind, corporations will continue to pervert these truly miraculous machines into making our decisions for us.  Alas, we've argued long enough Shill A!  Let's hear what the audience has to say...

Audience Member: Yes, um, Shill B, I'm an adjunct professor trying to figure out how to teach higher level forms of computational interaction to students that are struggling with concepts they should have learned in high school math.  None of them are actually using facebook, they are using the tumblr blogging platform to share a lot of music and images.  I've had them start using this same network to write analyses of their assigned reading with some basic HTML markup I've demonstrated for them in class.  I've been successful in creating an assignment that they will complete, but I worry about the actual relevance...

Shill B: An adjunct Prof, what an admirable job you have Audience Member.  Its great that you are teaching code in your classroom, but be careful, if you aren't teaching them about the biases inherent in these systems, whether it be on a facebook or a tumblr, they'll never actually understand how to CONTROL that technology... I hate to say it but the technology might continue to control them.

Shill A (interrupting): Hogwash!  The sad thing is, these kids DON'T have the math skills they need, and they still expect to get a passing grade in the classroom, and no offense to you Audience Member, but these teachers give them exactly that.  And we wonder why our economy is in the toilet?  Do you realize that we have more college graduates today than ever before, yet we have some of the lowest scores in the classes that COUNT: Science and math.  Why bother trying to teach these kids to code when they haven't yet learned how to do simple calculus!

Shill B:  This is JUST the kind of argument liberal arts curriculum has to deal with all the time, people like Audience Member are trying to INFUSE technology with liberal arts curriculum, and you fault him for that!  Fuck that! (Yeah, I said fuck, I'm edgy!)

Now lets deconstruct this quasi-fictional account.  At first glance, it might SEEM that Shill B has the more attractive approach to the subject at hand, but I've tried to make it pretty clear that what is going on is a good-cop/bad-cop indoctrination ritual.

The shills have taken a bag-o'-buzzwords and re-appropriated them to mean something only in a broken,  very specific, closed-off context.  Technology, codification, infusion... these words are given power only in how they manifest in a very present, very corporate/capitalist context without using such definitive adjectives within the suggested foundational definition given by the two arguing sides.  The audience member is led to accept the skewed version of the definition(s) in order to engage in the "conversation," but does his best to include a scenario that is of personal concern and can almost fit into the conversation's rhythmic constraints.  He attempts, slightly and politely, to break through said constraints by presenting the truly real-world scenario.  He is both attacked and defended, yet his question remains unanswered.

I'd argue that what is actually being illustrated in this scenario is a concept [Jean Baudrillard][Baudrillard] referred to as "Technics."  I'd try to summarize, but I think it is more powerful just to quote it, especially since the following very prescient words were published in 1969:

  * Every technical practice is a social practice, every technical practice is soaked in social determination.  But it doesn't present itself as such: it claims autonomy, innocence, a technical rationality founded on science.  This rationality subtends the ideology of faith, which imposes itself on our society as orality, wherein technical practices, separated from social reason, become a technique of the social, and more precisely of social manipulation, and therefore a technics of power. [(51)][utopie]

and

  * Advanced technics, cut from everyday technical practice and confusedly identified with science, comes to be able to serve the imaginary of the banal technics of "consumption" --exactly like educated culture fundamentally serves as an imaginary model for mass culture.  The spatial, nuclear, futuristic heroization of technics, that entire demiurge , that science fiction comes into play and is revealed in domestic gadgets that would thus not at all be experienced as effects, but transfigured as signs and as the promise of a total technological revolution, whose model is already here, suggested everywhere in the exalted and euphoric discourse on technics (which always doubles as a moral pessimistic discourse, complicit with the first, and which only reinforces the "dizzying" effect). [(57-58)][utopie]

That's right my millennial brethren, this same Goddamn conversation is not new.  The next time you hear some asshole say that social media is some evolutionary step in how we communicate, go read some hippie era pseudo-Marxists.  Realize that innovation does not mean what The Shills want you to think it means.  Is it really computer programming we need in our classrooms or a taste of sociological analysis?  

If you want something a little more recent that speaks directly to how these personal computer/internet "skinned" forms of "technics" evolved, I suggest Roy Rosenzweig's [Wizards, Bureaucrats, Warriors, and Hackers: Writing the History of the Internet][Rosenzweig].  Rosenzweig, [a figurehead in digital pedagogy][Rosenzweig2], describes in this text the evolution of networked, computer-mediated communication from all sides.  He describes the cold war technology foundational to most of the network systems we use today, and also talks about the "great man" biographies that sensationalize the roles played by corporate shills of the past that rebranded these networks for commercial gain, which I think in the context of this post is most relevant:

  * "Contextualist" approaches have long dominated academic studies of history of technology, but narratives of "great men" of science and technology remain popular, deriving their power both from widespread assumptions about new ideas emerging from particular men of genius as well as from the narrative appeal of biography. [(1531)][Rosenzweig]

I could quote more, but the entire article holds a lot of important information in each of its sentences.  It is suggested reading, and I linked to the full article.  [Here, I'll do it again.][Rosenzweig]

I need to wrap this rant up, and I hope at this juncture you get my point.  Just because certain powerful members of society have pushed us all to become infatuated with fetishized devices and using words like innovative, scientific, and technological as networked foreplay doesn't mean you have to let them jerk you off. 

And one more thing (for those of you reading this that know what this whole blog post is responding to): If you want to learn to program computers and/or write software, learn to program computers and/or write software.  I like doing it, and I definitely believe there are many correct ways and incorrect ways to do it, but PLEASE don't sit me down in a room and tell me why I NEED to do it, ESPECIALLY if you don't know how to.  I leave you with [a definition from the Urban Dictionary][Urban Dictionary], truly one of the internet's greatest scientific contributions (Disclosure: I cowrote this definition with booc0mtaco:)

  * Stuperior

  adj. exhibiting the complete absence of expertise or understanding, that breeds within an individual a certain capacity and desire to express their faux competence, culminating in an irony so perfect, it needs no further definition.

  His stuperior comments about how to properly ride a horse let you know he has no clue how it is done."
