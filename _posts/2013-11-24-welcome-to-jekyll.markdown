This is my first Jekyll blog, as I'm wrapping up my MA I want to be ready with a nice, minimal/lightweight resume page.  It seemed to me Jekyll was the way to go, and I'm definitely enjoying it more than, say, Wordpress.

The following code is left on this introductory post for personal reference:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
