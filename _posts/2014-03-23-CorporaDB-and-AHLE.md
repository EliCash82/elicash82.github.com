TEST Since I graduated at the beginning of January I've been working at Baruch College's Bernard L. Schwartz Communication Institute.  The job has been very interesting, and I've been able to experiment with a variety of software from Sinatra as a means of deploying documentation for [VOCAT][vocat] to Camtasia as a way to enhance filmed lectures.  I've even had the opportunity to make a few knick-knacks with a Makerbot 3D printer.

The major downside has been the fact that most of the higher-level Ruby coding being done for the project has been out of a shop in Portland, Oregon (I'm in NYC).  I've done a large amount of user-testing, making bug reports, guiding new users with initial use, but it hasn't been necessary for me to do a lot of coding.

This has required I do a lot of extracurricular coding on my own so that I don't lose my rhythm/momentum.  I've deployed two projects, still in various stages of development.

##### [CorporaDB][corporadb]

My first is CorporaDB: a relational-database of 19th Century Literature.  I tend to use books as the theme to any personal project.  On a personal level, a lot of the time I spent reading traditional prose fiction books has transformed into working through computer programming tutorials, manuals, and articles.  As much as I enjoy the active practice of programming, I continue to have an interest in the metadata of traditionally printed codices.

Right now a private CMS is set up to add book titles to the database, but moving forward I hope to add more novel forms of data than standard archival (i.e. Dublin Core style) metadata.  My initial thought was to just do some token analysis in R, and include this data in CorporaDB, but I'm interested in exploring minimalist OO code in the terminal, which leads to the latest project I've been working on.

##### [Anderson's HyperLit Engine (AHLE)][ahle]

This is a project in very early stages, based on some of the early projects I started when I was first trying to grapple with programming languages that exceeded HTML/CSS markup/styling.  The goal isn't necessarily to make an epic text adventure game, but rather consider how semi-advanced literary skills can be infused with an introduction to higher order computer use and literacy.

------

I'm enjoying these "hobby" projects, though really I wish I was working (as in working FOR PROFIT) on something that required these kinds of skills in an environment where they are being put to use, so that in my free time I could get back to reading and writing in more traditional forms and infusing code as a secondary force instead of a primary force.  I imagine that will come with time.
